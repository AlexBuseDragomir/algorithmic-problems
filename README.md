# Algorithmic problems

This repository contains implementations of common algorithmic problems, aimed at preparing for technical interviews.

The solutions included here are problems I have personally worked on. You can also find them on my [LeetCode account](https://leetcode.com/u/AlexandruBuseDragomir/).

While some solutions may not be optimal, exploring different approaches helps compare their time and space complexities.
